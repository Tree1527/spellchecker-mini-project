The flow of the code can be summarized as follows:

1. The code first defines several functions such as words(text), known(words), edits1(word), edits2(word), candidates(word), P(word), and correction(word, type)
2. Next, it creates a global variable word_ct which is a Counter object of all the words in the large text file (big.txt).
3. The main function is called with the input text as an argument.
4. The main function splits the input text into a list of words and calls the correction function for each word in the list.
5. The correction function first checks the input word against the frequency distribution (word_ct) of words from the large text file (big.txt)
6. If the word is not in the frequency distribution, it checks the set of words obtained from the edits1 and edits2 functions.
7. If no corrections are found, the input word is returned.
8. The correction function then uses the probability of the word obtained from the P function as the key to suggest most probable correction or all the possibilities of corrections.
9. The suggestions are returned by the main function and displayed in the GUI.

The flow of code is executed in the order of functions defined first and then main function is called with the input text, where the text is passed through different functions to get the suggestions.
