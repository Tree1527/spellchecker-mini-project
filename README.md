# Overview
This code is a spell checker that utilizes the Levenshtein distance algorithm to suggest possible corrections for misspelled words. The program uses the Tkinter library to create a GUI for the user to input text and receive spelling suggestions. The program reads a large text file (big.txt) to create a frequency distribution of words to base its suggestions off of. The user can choose to see the most probable correction or all possible corrections for each word in the inputted text. It appears to also have a GUI feature, where user can input the text through a textbox and the suggestions will be displayed in a label.
